# Udacity: Data Analyst Nanodegree
-----
#### Study Plan
- This repo is used for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.
- This curriculum path is outcome-based and career-oriented. Every program has a clear end-goal. Courses are built with industry leaders like Google, AT&T, and Facebook, and are taught by leading subject matter experts. 

#### Core Curriculum and Projects Syllabus
##### Project 1: Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data by Python
The warm-up project to get an overview of parts of the data analysis process and get a taste of what this program is all about. In this project, I will download Anaconda and use a Jupyter notebook to explore a bike sharing dataset. 
**Highlighted content**: Python, Jupyter Notebook
##### Project 2: Investigate a Dataset by Python
Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets -- Titanic data set -- investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.
**Highlighted content**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Vectorized Operations

##### Project 3: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon by Python
Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Give readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.
**Highlighted content**: Descriptive Statistics, Estimation, Hypothesis testing, Confidence Intervals, Z-scores, and T-tests

##### Project 4: Wikipedia Web Crawl Case Study
Apply the Python skills to explore real-world data from the web. Write a web crawler that follows links between Wikipedia articles.
**Highlighted content**: Python, requests, bs4, beautiful soup

**Highlighted content**: 

##### Project 5: Create a Tableau Story
Create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. Use Tableau to create the visualization. The work is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
**Highlighted content**: Dashboard, Story, Ration-ink Ratio, Visual Storytelling
##### Project 6: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data
Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Apply SQL and MongoDB to chosen schema to the project.
**Highlighted content**: SQL, MongoDB, Python, and Assess Data Quality

##### Project 7: Machine Learning: Identify Fraud from Enron Email
Play detective and put machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.
**Highlighted content**: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, F1 scores

##### Project 8: Exploratory Data Analysis with R
Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.
**Highlighted content**: R, Investigate Datasets, Reshape Data Frames

##### Project 9: Data Visualization in D3
torytelling with Data. Choose a dataset and use popular visualization libraries to create your own interactive visualizations.
**Highlighted content**: HTML, CSS, D3.js, dimple.js

##### Project 10: Design an A/B Test
Create an A/B Test for Udacity.com. Analyze the results of an A/B test and recommend whether or not to launch the change.
**Highlighted content**: Defining Experimental Groups and Validating Metrics

#### Extracurricular 
- Git and GitHub
- MongoDB
- Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce
